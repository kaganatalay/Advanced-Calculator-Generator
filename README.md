# Advanced Calculator Generator

Basically generates a brute-force calculator that checks the first number with all the possible values of the second number and if both numbers AND the operator inbetween matches, calculates the result and displays it.

To generate a code that calculates opeations up to 5, the program needs to do 5 * 5 * 4 (number of operations constant, +, -, /, *) operations, which takes a lot of time.

## Why?
Simply because I was bored and didn't have anything better to do.

## How to use?
*Please don't and use an actual calculator, but if you insist you want to generate the code for yourself*

On initialization the script prompts you with the generation type (Infinite (1) | Constrained (2)). Recommended- use constrained, your pc won't be able to generate the code for infinite, as it takes almost 1157407 years to complete on a standart pc.

After selecting Constrained (2), you need to provide a range. Recommended- 10 < x < 300. 
Press enter and wait for the output python file under /output/calculator.py
